    "# Determine if an exoplanet transit will be visible while we are in Sutherland\n",
    "To determine if a star is suitable for observing from Sutherland, we need to determine if the star is above the horizon, at a reasonable airmass during the night when an exoplanet transit occurs. Fortunately, trying to observe a tranit (or eclipse of a binary star) is quite common in astronomy, so there is a python package *astroplan* which we will use to determine if a transite is visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to adapt this code to read in a whole series of star coordinates and names.  You will likely want simplfy the output as well.  Note that the code runs, but has one mistake I put in on purpose. Make sure you correct the mistake.\n",

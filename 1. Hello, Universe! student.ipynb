I then approximated the volume of each sun, but not exactly as the real volume of each sun. Instead, I included the space between suns as well, so it is more apt to say that, for each star, I calculated the volume of the sphere for which there are no other stars in the radius of the sphere. A sort of \"sphere of isolation\". Half the distance between Our star and Proxima Centauri was used for this calculation. Dividing The galaxy volume by this sphere of isolation yields the approximate number of stars in the galaxy. Of course, this sphere isn't exactly correct (binary stars, clusters, large areas with no stars), and neither is the volume of the galaxy, so we can only really say it is precise up to the order-of-magnitude.\n",

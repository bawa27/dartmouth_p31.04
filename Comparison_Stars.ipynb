    "Once you are satisified that you have the correct brightness limits, and so your final sample of comparison stars, you need to assign a priority class to this star, ranging from 1 (must observe) to 4 (do not observe).  Append this priority class column to your input csv file of target stars (RRLyr?.csv).  In adition, append a column which indicates if this target can be observed with SHOC (and its much smalle field of view).  The name of this column should be 'SHOC' and with boolean values (True or False).  Finally, append a colomn with the RA  in hours, minutes and seconds (hint: astropy has utilities to do this conversion). Why do we want this column? "
